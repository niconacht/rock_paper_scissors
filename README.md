# Functionality

Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the Computer in the Browser. Just click to choose your item, you can play 5 rounds. 
Then click reset (to be added) to restart the game. 

## Design Concept
With this project, I experimented with responsive font units. Overall, I practiced progressive enhancement, building the website up from mobile to desktop. I made use of fluid size units up to desktop size where I brought in a media query and there changed some critical stylings to fixed units
